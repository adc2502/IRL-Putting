# IRL Putting

Written around the end of 2020.

During lockdown, my flat mates and I would have indoor putting competitions. 
We wanted to see who was the best statistically, so I programmed a game where you could register users 
and create new competitions and customise the hole par value. 
You would be shown an updated leadboard as time went on and it would be stored in a csv file.
